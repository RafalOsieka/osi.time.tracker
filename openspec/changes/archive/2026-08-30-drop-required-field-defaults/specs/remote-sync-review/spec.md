## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: REQ-114 Required remote fields with fetched options and pre-fill

For each otherwise manageable row, the Remote Sync page SHALL fetch the configured tracker's
required-field activity options through the neutral remote-tracker adapter contract once per resolved
scope and expose them in a labeled select. The select SHALL
prefer the task's most recently finalized activity when it matches a fetched option, and SHALL
otherwise remain unselected. The page SHALL NOT pre-fill from tracker-level required-field defaults.
Selected values SHALL remain page state until finalization. A successful empty response SHALL produce a
read-only no-activity state stating that no activity is available and the task will not be pushed.
A failed request SHALL produce a translated accessible retryable error without blocking unrelated
rows.

#### Scenario: Activities are fetched and selectable
- **WHEN** the page loads with otherwise manageable rows whose configuration has a registered adapter
- **THEN** each row SHALL offer the activities fetched for its resolved activity scope

#### Scenario: Rows sharing a scope reuse one fetch
- **WHEN** multiple rows resolve to the same activity scope
- **THEN** the adapter SHALL fetch activities once and reuse the result

#### Scenario: Previously used activity takes precedence
- **WHEN** provenance provides a valid most-recent activity that matches a fetched option
- **THEN** the previously used activity SHALL be selected

#### Scenario: Config default is the fallback
- **WHEN** no valid previously used activity exists
- **THEN** the activity control SHALL remain unselected and SHALL NOT be pre-filled from tracker-level required-field defaults

#### Scenario: No matching pre-fill leaves the control unselected
- **WHEN** no valid previously used activity exists or it does not match a fetched option
- **THEN** the activity control SHALL remain unselected without an error

#### Scenario: Successful empty response prevents export
- **WHEN** the scope-scoped fetch succeeds with no activities
- **THEN** affected rows SHALL be read-only with a stated reason that no activity is available and
  their time will not be pushed to the remote system

#### Scenario: Options fetch fails and can be retried
- **WHEN** an activities request fails because of credentials, CORS, or network conditions
- **THEN** affected rows SHALL show an accessible retry action and SHALL NOT be classified as having
  no activities

### Requirement: REQ-115 Day-review data is aggregated server-side and user-scoped
The application SHALL provide an authenticated read endpoint that returns the day-review aggregate for a given date: per task with entries that day — task identity and name, project name, optional tracker name, the summed original duration, the Tracker configuration surface needed for state derivation (system type, rounding rule, execution mode, base URL, tracker id), and the remote issue reference (remote issue ID and cached title) when present — plus the untitled-entries total. The tracker configuration surface SHALL NOT include required-field defaults. All data SHALL be scoped to the authenticated user; durations SHALL be returned unrounded; timestamps SHALL be ISO strings; no credential material SHALL ever be included. Invalid dates SHALL be rejected with a `{ messageKey, params }` validation error. The payload SHALL NOT include a Client identity or `clientName`.

#### Scenario: Aggregate returns one row per task with tracker and link state
- **WHEN** an authenticated user requests the day review for a valid date
- **THEN** the response SHALL contain one row per Task with entries that day, carrying the summed duration, resolvable tracker surface when present, and issue reference when present

#### Scenario: Foreign data is never included
- **WHEN** another user has entries on the same date
- **THEN** the response SHALL contain only the authenticated user's tasks and entries

#### Scenario: Invalid date is rejected
- **WHEN** the date parameter is missing or not a valid calendar date
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL respond with a 422 `{ messageKey, params }` validation error

#### Scenario: No credentials in the payload
- **WHEN** the day review is returned for projects with trackers
- **THEN** the payload SHALL include no API secret or credential material

#### Scenario: No required-field defaults in the payload
- **WHEN** the day review is returned for projects with trackers
- **THEN** the tracker configuration surface SHALL NOT include `requiredFieldDefaults`
